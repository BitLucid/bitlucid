BitLucid Wordpress Site
--------------------------

Repository for the code of [BitLucid Programming](http://bitlucid.com) http://bitlucid.com


A mysql testing database is available via dropbox in /unclean-bittest/  Ask for an update before using it if you want the most up-to-date version of the data!


Note also the existence of this convenient little command line script wp-cli for making certain wordpress modifications:

http://wp-cli.org/

It's great, for example, at replacing the current url to allow for dev installs:

    wp search-replace 'http://bitlucid.com' 'http://bit.local'
